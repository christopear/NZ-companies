# NZ-companies

Script that can be used to webscrape companies from the [NZ Companies Registry](https://companies-register.companiesoffice.govt.nz/).

Unfortunately, there are 1M+ companies on file. with the data only provided in the individual webpages it would be too much to webscrape all information out of this source unless an alternative option is developed.

* 1.3M * 250KB = 325GB
* 1.3M, @ 1 every 2 seconds = 30 days
